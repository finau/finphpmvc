This PHP MVC framework is just the basic building block of MVC.

I create this MVC as part of my job interview, but I would like to release it for anyone who would like to play with.

Features:
- Show how the request is routing to the controller.
- Show how to handle database query safely by utilizing the MYSQLI prepare statement.
- Show how to response in JSON format.
- Show how you separate your view from your controller and model.

You can watch this youtube video which show a basic usage of this framework.
